# -Monte-Carlo-Football-Betting-Simulator
This project simulates football betting outcomes using historical EPL match data and Monte Carlo simulations. It evaluates potential betting profits/losses using a simple flat betting strategy.

📌 Project Overview

BetSim is a data-driven project that analyzes historical football betting data using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate betting strategies and bankroll fluctuations. The goal is to understand betting risks, expected returns, and payout distributions.

🔍 Key Features:

Flat Betting Strategy: Simulates betting using a fixed stake.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Runs 1,000 parallel betting simulations for robust analysis.

Risk Assessment: Evaluates the probability of gains or losses over multiple bets.

Data Visualization: Uses histograms, KDE plots, box plots, and violin plots for deeper insights.

Parallel Processing: Enhances performance using joblib.

📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset (E0.csv) contains historical English Premier League (EPL) match data, including:

Column

Description

Date

Match date

HomeTeam

Home team name

AwayTeam

Away team name

FTHG

B365H

Bet365 odds for home win

B365D

Bet365 odds for draw

B365A
